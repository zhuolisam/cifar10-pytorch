Hey there , 
Image Classification using Cifar10 Dataset is so Popular image classification model and i just try to do the project from my current understandings.

i just use the Streamlit Library to create a web app for more easily accessable.
and you can easily change the model hyperparameter to enhance the power of your model

The accuracy now is still low as we are only using shallow neural nets, further improvement such as fine-tuning, add regularization, image augmentation.
